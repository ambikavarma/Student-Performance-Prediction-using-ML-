This project applies machine learning techniques to predict student academic performance and stress levels using diverse factors such as socioeconomic background, study habits, mental health, and extracurricular involvement. A dataset capturing both academic and well-being attributes was processed through data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis. Regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest) were used for academic performance prediction, while classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM) were applied to stress level prediction. Random Forest and SVM outperformed other models, achieving high accuracy and reliability. The system was deployed via a Flask web application, providing an interactive interface for educators and administrators to input student data and receive predictive insights. The ultimate goal is to enable proactive interventions, resource allocation, and improved educational outcomes through data-driven decision-making.
